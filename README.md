Simple Twitch App
===============

Front-End for browsing twitch via API built in Angular. Built this while learning angular, perhaps could be useful for such a purpose for anyone else. 

It doesn't really bring anything new to the table, it does however focus more on viewer count. There's simple routing, filtering, it shows the most popular games. In the games you see a infinite scroll list of streams and these can be clicked and viewed. There is simple caching of the API calls as well.
